#Fluttrly-gem

##What is this?
Fluttrly-gem is a command line gem I decided to make to help contribute to
[fluttrly](http://github.com/excid3/fluttrly).


##Why?
I wanted to know how to write gems with the new way bundler makes them, and I saw
[Holman](http://github.com/holman) make [boom](http://github.com/holman/boom). So I wanted to make a
command line utility myself. Sweet!


##Disclaimer
If you somehow get hurt using this. You're retarded. That being said, I shipped this as soon as possible,
so not all of the features are done yet.


##Usage

** List an item **
    #fluttrly <command> <list>
    $ fluttrly list bouverdafs
    Task => "Nothing to see here, move along" at => 02-08-2011 18:57 PM 
		
##Install 
    gem install fluttrly
